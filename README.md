# SARDINE Agent
The SARDINE project, acronym of "SwARm-based eDge computiNg systEms", aims at building a multi-platform lightweight framework for collaborative nodes with decentralized edge intelligence. Inspired by nature, groups of nodes are organized like a swarm, emphasizing the edge-to-edge continuum of the device-edge-cloud paradigm. This supports a paradigm shift from programming enviroments for individual devices to dynamic and cooperating groups of nodes.

The SARDINE Agent is the agent version for processors and micro-processors. The implementation follows the guidelines of the SARDINE design, and it is fully integrated in the SARDINE ecosystem.
